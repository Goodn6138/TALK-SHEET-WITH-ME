        "**Excel remains a widely used tool across many industries, including healthcare.**\n",
        "Despite its popularity, many users struggle with even basic functionalities due to the steep learning curve associated with mastering Excel.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the development of autonomous agents, there's now an opportunity to bridge this gap. These models bring semantic understanding to user instructions and can execute complex Excel tasks through intelligent agents—reducing the need for in-depth technical knowledge.\n",

        "**At Blank, our mission is to reimagine the way humans interact with Excel.**\n",
        "We are developing an intuitive interface that leverages LLMs to simplify spreadsheet operations, helping users perform tasks through natural language commands. By minimizing the learning curve, we empower users to be more productive without requiring advanced Excel training.\n",

        "3. **AI-Powered Translation**\n",
        "   On the server, the commands are interpreted using Cohere’s API, which semantically understands the input and converts it into valid Excel command logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Execution & Response**\n",
        "   The resulting Excel code is sent back to the app for execution within the user's spreadsheet environment, effectively allowing users to perform complex tasks with simple language.\n",
